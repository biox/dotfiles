# dotfiles
My i3 dotfiles - I use a Thinkpad T450s running Trisquel as a distribution. I have put a lot of time into customizing the configuration and aesthetic to suit my purposes, and figured I would contribute back in case anyone was in need of similar files.

A huge thanks to Alex Booker for his incredible i3 configuration guides.
